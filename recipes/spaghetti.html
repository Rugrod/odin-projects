    <h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <br>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in boiling water until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Transfer to a bowl and mix in spaghetti sauce.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Place 1/2 of the butter slices into the bottom of a 9x13-inch casserole dish. Spread 1/2 of the spaghetti into the dish.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Mix cottage cheese, cream cheese, and sour cream together in a bowl; spread mixture over spaghetti. Cover with remaining spaghetti and top with remaining slices of butter.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Pour ground beef mixture over spaghetti and spread in an even layer.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Spread Cheddar cheese on top and continue baking until cheese has melted and is lightly browned, about 15 minutes more.</li>
    </ol>
